Hi! I am a self-taught data scientist, entrepreneur, and systems thinker passionate about fostering transparency, interoperability, and critical thinking in tackling complex challenges. Currently, Iâ€™m developing RiskSleuth, a platform to help investors understand risk correlations in public company portfolios, leveraging expertise in machine learning, economic modeling, and probabilistic programming. Originally from Russia and living in the U.S. since 2015, I have continuously educated myself as an engineer and scientist, guided by a lifelong commitment to the scientific method and interdisciplinary problem-solving. With experience building fintech tools that prioritize transparency and access, I aim to create systems that improve understanding, foster innovation, and drive meaningful change across industries.
