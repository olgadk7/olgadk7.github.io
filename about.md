Ever since I came to the US in 2015 I have been fascinated with how business and economy works in this country. This preoccupation has led me to switch careers **from humanitarian to technology**: having learned how data can be used in a small but mighty arts PR shop, I wanted to know what other, more impactful problems can these processes be scaled to. So I picked up the basics at a data science bootcamp course, and went through a discovery phase of the different applications of the skills, narrowing down to growth analytics for small businesses. 

Throughout this journey I also kept an eye on the cryptocurrency space, dollar-cost-averaging blue chip tokens since the end of the 2017 bull run. So when in Q4 of 2021 I came across interfaces for querying blockchain, such as Dune, the Graph, and Nansen, I was happy that I could apply the analytics stack of **web2 to web3**. Blockchain is a database of of transactions, after all, so I was happy to upgrade my passive investment approach with on-chain analytics sleuthing. 

The common thread that guided me through finding my place in the tech world was the striving for the transparent processes, open-source tools, accessible knowledge, borderless communities - and the obtainable infrastructure behind it that powers it all. **Open finance** ecosystem resonates with me in particular because it empowers participation and literacy previously accessible to very limited groups. Open finance made available by blockchain system is not ideal, but much closer to being free of tempering, silos, bias, bureaucracies, inefficiencies than other forms of record-keeping and coordination we have. Knowing what living in Soviet Russia was like from my parents (and from literature), and having studied international political economy in college, crypto gives me hope.

The markets in general are interesting to me because they represent a quantitatively accurate snapshot that’s an approximation of the collective irrational human psyche behind it. The fact that in web3 incentives can be engineered using smart contracts allows for a never ending experimentation. While there are many potential great use-cases, a lot of the time it ends up introducing circular complexity for the sake of stimulating activity / adoption. As such, it can be overwhelming to understand how asset value (and price) is formed. Currently my aspiration is to **automate the opportunities** in DeFi into a pipeline / dashboard that would facilitate making data-informed decisions. Would love to connect with people doing similar things, so reach out if you’re interested!
